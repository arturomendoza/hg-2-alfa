The "Group 5" community expects the activities:

1. Be a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Be a place where they can express their identities freely.
3. Assume the value of others. Everyone's ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Do not assume that all participants have or understand the same context and promote discussion and questions.
5. That its members be encouraged to listen as they speak.
6. Strive to create tools that are open and free for public use. Priority will be given to activities that promote the public use of these tools and technologies; not private gain.
7. Priority access and input will be given to people who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
8. Ensure that the entire community is represented in the planning, design, and implementation of any civic technology. This includes the participation of women, minorities, and groups that have traditionally been marginalized.
9. Actively involve community groups and those who have expertise in the issue and in the decision-making process.
10. Ensure that conversations between community members and friends of the community are respectful, productive, and participatory.
11. Provide an environment free from discrimination and harassment.
 
"Group 5" reserves the right to ask any person not to participate in its activities if they have violated any of these rules.
